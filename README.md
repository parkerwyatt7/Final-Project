# Final-Project
This is my final project for Intro to Programming in Python. I have a few ideas for what I wish to do, which are creating a mini game of snake or use turtles to display an image the user wishes to input.
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on working alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Does the final project have to be a complicated project for us to do? Something that wouldnt necessarily take less than a day to do?
